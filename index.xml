&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The conference happened from Wednesday 26th to Friday 28th of February. My company had five non-reserved tickets shared among developers and team leads, who attended one or two days. I first heard about the conference on Wednesday 26th (it has already started), and, an hour later, I was designated to replace a colleague who could no longer attend on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference was held at the Hotel Bonaventure, just a 10-minute walk from my place.
Inside the hotel, on the 10th floor, I passed by the Nordic spa outdoor pools. The hot water and the cold air produced impressive columns of steam. The thick layer of snow around the pool made the setting feel more natural, in the heart of the concrete jungle of Montreal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was supposed to fetch the access badge at the reception in the morning. But, the day before, all my colleagues had not returned their badges. Some left them at the office. After explaining that it was not a good practice (if allowed at all), they were kind enough to grant me a badge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="networking-with-fellow-developers">Networking With Fellow Developers
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I had never met in person with my colleagues attending the conference. Even if we have offices in the Mile-End, we are a remote first company.
Given the short amount of time we spent together, I built strong relationships with these colleagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breakfasts, lunches, transitions between talks, and afterworks were put into good use to talk about tech and forge connections.
The tech conversations were deeper and broader than usual, because they took place in a special environment and were fueled by diverse talks we just attended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Talking to the conference speakers and asking question was also very valuable. After all, they are &amp;lsquo;fellow&amp;rsquo; developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conference-talks">Conference Talks
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ten Talks were scheduled every hour from 9 AM to 4 PM, with each session lasting 45 minutes. I enjoyed the variety of subjects and technologies: some accessible to a broad audience, others more niche. One of the talks was tied to and illustrated with a specific programming language, even if it did no mention it. Prerequisites are usually clearly stated in the descriptions, which proved to be both useful and accurate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While speakers came from all over the world (mostly from North America), the majority of attendees seem to be from Quebec, judging by the language I heard in the corridors. The presenters had extensive and sometime impressive experiences in the software industry. Their point of view reflected that, and I think resonated with more senior developers. For instance, talking about using AI coding assistants, one of them said you should use it on a language and a framework you really know well.
I noticed a surprisingly large number of consultants (corporate trainers, for instance) among the speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending 7 talks a day felt like going to university on a packed day when you are back to school. For one, I barely knew anybody.
It was surprisingly tiring. Working from home, I am not used to the constant auditory stimulation. Fortunately, taking notes helped me to stay focus the whole time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After seven talks, conversations in busy corridors, a loud lunch, and a 5 Ã  7 (afterwork) with music, my ears hurt a bit and I had a light headache.
It was a small price to pay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The quality of the talks was high, even when compared to the star programmers on YouTube sometimes. And I believe most of the talks will be useful for my job in a not-too-distant future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-perks-and-the-fun-stuff">The Perks And The Fun Stuff
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There is a free cloakroom. So bring comfortable indoor shoes and leave your winter shoes there.
There are water fountains and glasses everywhere.
In the sponsors room, where breakfast is served, there are juice, flavored water, and baristas all day long. So you do not need to bring a flask.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lunch was healthy and reasonably tasty. Meat was not nearly cooked to perfection, but what quality can you expect for thousands of people. I cannot complain, except for the noise in the massive dining room.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sponsors">Sponsors
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Sponsors were mostly local (Canadian) companies rather than big tech companies. I believe they were here to hire developers and/or increase their brand recognition. They provided (useful) goodies and lottery tickets for bigger prizes. Many people were called on stage at the end of the conference to receive their gifts, along with multiple award recipients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It was a great learning and fun experience.
I felt a surprisingly strong sense of belonging in the developer community, and in my company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you there in 2026!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://victong2.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victong2.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://victong2.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victong2.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
